# Setting-Out
My very first github project to track my changes as I learn my first proper programming language; Python.



# My Current Position
I am a student just starting out my journey into the world of programming. Since Python is one of the key languages in the requirements for AI/ML jobs, that is the language I decided was optimal to break me in into the computing world.

While I have used Visual Basic and simple HTML before, none of them were used or explored to the extent I that I would say I could even be considered to have passed the beginner's level of expertise in using them. As I continue on this task, I plan to track all of my daily python tests and practises in this repository. If I were to take on more complex or specialized projects, I will create a separate repository for them.



# Aims
My aims of this project are to learn the fundamentals of Python and keep studying the language until I can be considered an intermediate user. All of my practice code and simple self-study test codes that are generated as a result of my daily practice goes here.

My main aim is to become an Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning engineer and be able to break into the field by the time I am done with University. 



# Project Files
The version of Python currently being used in this project is 3.7.2. 

The files that can be found in this repo are python source code files that have several small blocks of code that serve their own functions. Every single block of code in the files is a practice or a test, segregated by comments that preface what their purpose is.
